SDL2 Bindings for .NET Core

This library contains bindings for:
 - SDL2 (`SDLTooSharp.Bindings.SDL2.SDL`)
 - SDL2 Image (`SDLTooSharp.Bindings.SDL2Image.SDLImage`)
 - SDL2 Mixer (`SDLTooSharp.Bindings.SDL2Mixer.SDLMixer`)
 - SDL2 TTF (`SDLTooSharp.Bindings.SDL2Ttf.SDLTtf`)

Due to how C# works, it is impossible to create exact bindings for the whole library. Please note that all strings are treated as `UTF-8` strings.

SDLTooSharp follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). All changes can be found in the [Change log](CHANGELOG.md).

Feel free to open an issue and/or a pull request in case you stumble upon a bug.
